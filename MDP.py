        ## The value iteration algorithm.  You may use any value for gamma
        ## between 0 and 1 (typically set to something like 0.99).  The number
        ## of updates to carry out is not fixed, but you must run until the
        ## resulting policy converges and stops changing.  You can do this by
        ## iterating until the utility values stop changing by much.  Usually,
        ## this is accomplished by setting some parameter epsilon (small value,
        ## on the order of .1, .01, etc.), summing up the differences between
        ## state utility values before and after the update, and checking
        ## whether it is less than epsilon.
